### A string is given containing alphabets
### You can choose to delete characters that are continious and repeated
### You cannot delete single characters
### Your goal is to reduce the string to the minimum possible string

eg :  CACBBCABBAC
   -> CACBBCAAC
   -> CACBBCC
   -> CACCCC
   -> CA
So, result = 3
